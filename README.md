## Final Project - Reality Filters and How Minds Change

This project is a website that aims to make people reflect upon their own biases. It aims to do so by letting people explore strange color phenomena and teach the basics of how our brains understand our surrounding.
Furthermore it should include a forum for people to post their own experiences, as well as a chatbot that helps people learn respectful conversation techniques.

The project is based on the book "How Minds Change" by David McRaney.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
